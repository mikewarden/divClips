# divClips

Hi everyone. DivWaves is my first repository. I created it from scratch using the concept of an Akai MPC sampler as a source of inspiration. Im fairly new to web development and wanted to share some of my work with experienced developers and learn to code more efficiently and practical. There is a lot of room for improvements on this, including a master volume slider, changing the location of the volume sliders, audio effects? potentially converting some of the vanilla JS into jQuery, etc..

Also another aspect of this project would be changing out the audio samples which will be added to branches. As long as the samples are in a common time signature and tempo they seem to work ok, however there is plenty of room for improvement. 

I have the original divWaves hosted on my website mikewarden.com.

Thanks and Enjoy!
